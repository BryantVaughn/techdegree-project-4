# Style Guide Project

This is the fourth project in the Front-End Web Developer Treehouse Techdegree. The requirements for this project were to take the CSS styles from within the `resources/` folder and recreate them using Sass. The overall feel and layout of the style guide should be similar between both the `resources/index.html` and the root `index.html`.
